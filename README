EverTex Greasemonkey script version 1.1
EverTex Chrome Extension version 1.0 
---------------

EverTex is a Chrome/Firefox extension that shows LaTeX formulas in EverNote's web interface using MathJax. 

*ATTENTION*
Due to some bugs, the current Chrome version of EverTex does *NOT* work. The Greasemonkey version works well in Firefox.

The Greasemonkey script for Firefox is also available at:

With EverTex you can write formulas with MathJax grammar in EverNote webpage's WYSIWYG editor and preview them in the mathematical way.

Just like MathJax, the formulas should be surrounded by $$...$$, \[...\], and \(...\) to be properly rendered.

For more information you can refer to MathJax's webpage (wwww.mathjax.org).
